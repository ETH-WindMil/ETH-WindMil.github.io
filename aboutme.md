### my history

After I finished my Civil engineering studies in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, I found my true *"calling"* in Computational Science. This led me to Zurich, where I finished my MSc at ETH, while also doing a brief internship in the banking sector as a software developer.
After that I worked as a research assistant in the Risk Safety and Uncertainty Quantification group at ETH where I contributed to the Matlab software UQLab, through the implementation and integration of new computational methods and maintainance of existing ones.
