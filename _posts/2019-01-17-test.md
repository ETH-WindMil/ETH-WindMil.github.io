# Wake effects
## What are Wake effects?
When placed in a farm, wind turbines produce disturbances to the air that 
they extract kinetic energy from. These disturbances are commonly referred to  as **wakes**.

[//]: # " ## Discovering wake effects from data"


Due to the complex aero-dynamic interactions, wakes may affect down-wind turbines in non-obvious manners while evolving on 
real wind farms. Moreover, different ambient wind conditions affect how wakes evolve.

It is therefore important to have an automated and scalable technique to statistically model the effect of 
wakes under different wind conditions.


[//]: # " ## Simulation of wake effects and statistical modelling"
We simulated 1000 wind turbulence intensity, wind orientation and mean windspeed condition using NREL-OpenFAST \[[1](https://nwtc.nrel.gov/OpenFAST)\]  and the Dynamic Wake Meandering subroutines \[[2](https://nwtc.nrel.gov/DWM)\] .
In our recent work ( [preprint](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charilaos_Mylonas/publication/329911304_Deep_Unsupervised_Learning_For_Condition_Monitoring_and_Prediction_of_High_Dimensional_Data_with_Application_on_Windfarm_SCADA_Data/links/5c22448592851c22a3462bae/Deep-Unsupervised-Learning-For-Condition-Monitoring-and-Prediction-of-High-Dimensional-Data-with-Application-on-Windfarm-SCADA-Data.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=BWZKxXUlHOd3hGxsxM2Rkso96mHlexhRoZ4k0AozSlPhNbuBYt1PNv0MHTY4CpDsMuJ4mOuOVuxxr8ZTkJB03Q.pWW1YXWnhOLr7M3xQvn-RYlALErgLBUqqJTlRo1s6qHRG1Fvoldq9IWwRDgUVSB55BZLXpreaZodVHF9QbIoOQ&_sg%5B1%5D=u6VTo-T9ZkyaJEUQdGW49GPyHALsNah7yYJbCcP5jmJYKcYna7tQI1skDpca7jbIIq9D0jJubVPFPO7AyVzVj77Gih25-4jc-UlmJf7EpLFa.pWW1YXWnhOLr7M3xQvn-RYlALErgLBUqqJTlRo1s6qHRG1Fvoldq9IWwRDgUVSB55BZLXpreaZodVHF9QbIoOQ&_iepl=) ), to be presented on the  [IMAC XXXVI conference](https://sem.org/imac) , we demonstrate how a custom neural network architecture, based on the **Variational Autoencoder** (VAE) [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114) can accurately map the effect of wakes on a farm, even with 
a relatively limited amount of samples. 

The loss function of the VAE reads:
$$  ELBO(X,z) = \log P(X) - D_{KL}[Q(z \vert X) \Vert P(z \vert X)] = E[\log P(X \vert z)] - D_{KL}[Q(z \vert X) \Vert P(z)] $$
Where $$ X $$ are the raw monitoring variables, $$ z $$ is a lower dimensional representation of the raw variables.

The loss function of the VAE attempts to jointly discover a lower dimensional representation for the data, while at the same time *warping* the raw data in such a way that it is modelled with 
a simple probability distribution. The $$ D_{KL} $$ term *pushes* the lower dimensional representation $$ z $$ to a simple probability distribution, whereas the second term helps is forcing the identification 
of the latent structure in the data.

## Some Results
In the following animation, samples from the trained autoencoder are shown, where the mean wind speed of the farm is controlled.
The arrows represent the wind orientation as it is sensed from each turbine

Effective turbulence intensity is another parameter affected by the wakes.

Red dots correspond to the simulated cases. The rest of the data points correspond to samples from the VAE, which generalizes in a realistic manner from the available data.

![Joint distribution of windspeed and turbulence intensity on all turbines](/img/wspti.png)
The orange dots corresponds to VAE-sampled data, whereas the blue correspond to real data.
The VAE captures effectively the joint distribution of the wind characteristics at different points, accounting for the effect of wakes.
