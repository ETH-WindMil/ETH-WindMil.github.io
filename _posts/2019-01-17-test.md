# Wake effects
## What are Wake effects?
When placed in a farm, wind turbines produce disturbances to the air that 
they extract kinetic energy from. These disturbances are commonly referred to  as **wakes**.

## Discovering wake effects from data
In order to automate the quantification wake effects have on turbine remaining life and power production, we need derive automated methods.

## Simulation of wake effects and statistical modelling
We simulated 1000 wind turbulence intensity, wind orientation and mean windspeed condition using NREL-OpenFAST [1] and the Dynamic Wake Meandering subroutines.
In our recent work, to be presented on IMAC XXXVI, we demonstrate how a custom neural network architecture, based on the **Variational Autoencoder** [3] can accurately map the effect of wakes on a farm, even with 
a relatively limited amount of samples. 


## Results
In the following animation, samples from the trained autoencoder are shown, where the mean wind speed of the farm is controlled.
The arrows represent the wind orientation as it is sensed from each turbine

Effective turbulence intensity is another parameter affected by the wakes.

Red dots correspond to the simulated cases. The rest of the data points correspond to samples from the VAE, which seems to generalize realistically.
